**Short-Answer Questions (80 pts)**

1) (10 pts) Design a 4-1 multiplexer using only NOR gate. Show the truth table and logic circuit.

2) (10 pts) Using only T flip-flops and standard gates, design a device which divides a clock by 8 and has a duty cycle of 1/8th.

 |  |

3) (10 pts) Say you are working in a system where the only component you have available is a 2-to-1 MUX. Show how to build a 2-input NOR gate from those MUXes. You can freely connect inputs to "1" and "0" as needed. Label the inputs as "A" and "B". Label the output as "X". Your solution must use 3 or fewer of the MUXes to receive credit.

4) (10 pts) Design a finite state machine (FSM) for a counter that counts through the 3-bit prime numbers downwards. Assume the counter starts with initial prime value set to 010 as its first 3 bit prime number. You need to provide the state transition table and the state transition diagram. Assume that the state is stored in three D-FFs. Hint: The set of all 3-bit prime numbers includes 2, 3, 5 and7.

5) (10 pts) Write the finite state machine (FSM) of the circuit shown below. Hint: In the given DEMUX below, S2 is the input signal, S1=Q1, S0=Q0, and there is a single output labeled as M.

6) (10 pts) Use a Karnaugh map to find all of the static hazards in the corresponding two-level circuit, and design a hazard-free circuit that realizes the same logic functions: F = W'X' + Y'Z + W'XYZ + WXYZ'
 (The definition of static hazards can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(logic)#Static_hazards)

7) (10 pts) Consider flip-flops A, B and C each nominally clocked off of the same clock. Assume:
 - a. Each flip-flop has a set-up time of 5ns and a clock-to-Q delay of 3ns to 4ns,
 - b. The AND and OR gates each have a delay of 2 to 6 ns,
 - c. The NOT gate has a delay of 1 to 5 ns.

  Answer the following questions and show your work:
 - Q1. What is the shortest clock period you could safely clock this system at? Show your work. 
 - Q2. What is the (non-negative) range of values for the flip-flopâ€™s hold time would be sufficient?

8) (10 pts) You wish to design a state machine that has one input "A" and one Moore-type output "Z". Z should be a 1 if and only if the last 6 values of A were "0". Due to budget cuts, you only have the following devices available:

 - a. 2-input gates of any standard type (AND, OR, NOR, NAND, XOR, and XNOR).
 - b. Inverters
 - c. Modulo-16 counters with enable and reset
 - d. 4 to 16 decoders 
 - e. 2-to-1 MUX (1-bit wide).

   Using as few devices as possible, implement the state machine described above. Solutions which use more than 4 devices will receive no credit.
