**Multiple Choices Questions (10 pts)**

1) (2 pts) For the given Verilog testbench snippet, identify X and Y.
```
module Gate (p, q, r, y);
   input p, q, r;
   output reg y;

   // Module description
endmodule

module Testbench ();
   X
   Y

   Gate Gate_tb (p_tb, q_tb, r_tb, y_tb); 
   // Designer-provided input values 
   ...
endmodule
```

- a. X: reg p_tb, q_tb, r_tb; Y: wire y_tb;
- b. X: wire y_tb; Y: reg p_tb, q_tb, r_tb;
- c. X: wire y_tb; Y: always @ (p, q, r);
- d. X: reg p_tb, q_tb, r_tb; Y: always @ (y);

2) (2 pts) The given testbench code generates the timing waveform shown in the figure. Identify the correct snippet that must be placed instead of ZZZ to obtain the given waveform.

```
`timescale 1 ns/ 1 ns
module Lightcontroller (a, b, c);
   input a, b; 
   output reg c;

   always @ (a, b) begin
      c = a & b;
   end
endmodule

module Testbench ();
   reg a_tb, b_tb;
   wire c_tb;
   Lightcontroller Lightcontroller_tb (a_tb, b_tb, c_tb);

   Initial begin
         a_tb = 1;
         b_tb = 0;
         ZZZ
         #10 a_tb = 1;
    end

endmodule
```

   output reg z;
 
   always @ (x, y) begin
          z = x | y;
   end
endmodule

module Testbench ();

         y_tb = 1;
        #20 x_tb = 1;
         y_tb = 0;
      end


 endmodule
```

**Short-Answer Questions (40 pts)**

1) (5 pts) Trace the behavior of a level-sensitive SR latch for the input pattern in Figure below. Assume S1, R1, and Q are initially 0. Complete the timing diagram, assuming logic gates have a tiny but non-zero delay.

2) (5 pts) Using four registers, design a circuit that stores the four values present at an 8-bit input D during the previous four clock cycles. The circuit should have a single 8-bit output that can be configured using two inputs s1 and s0 to output any one of the four registers.

 |  |

3) (5 pts) Draw a state diagram for an FSM that has an input X and an output Y. Whenever X changes from 0 to 1, Y should become 1 for two clock cycles and then return to 0 -- even if X is still 1. (Assume for this problem and all other FSM problems that an implicit rising clock is ANDed with every FSM transition condition.)

4) (5 pts) Using the process for designing a controller, convert the FSM you
created in problem 3) into a controller, implementing the controller using a state register and logic gates.

5) (5 pts) Design a 4-bit register with 2 control inputs s1 and s0, 4 data inputs I3, I2, I1 and I0, and 4 data outputs Q3, Q2, Q1 and Q0. When s1s0=00, the register maintains its value. When s1s0=01, the register loads I3..I0. When s1s0=10, the register clears itself to 0000. When s1s0=11, the register complements itself, so for example 0000 would become 1111, and 1010 would become 0101.

6) (5 pts) Design a system that computes the sum of three 8-bit numbers using 8-bit carry-ripple adders.

7) (5 pts) Let $ \mathbf{X} = X3 X2 X1 X0 $ denote the contents of register R, shown in this circuit, as a twoâ€™s complement number. After exactly two clock ticks, what is the contents of R?

8) (5 pts) Design a Moore-type state transition diagram for a state machine that has one input (X) and one output (A). The output should go high if the last three instances of X were the same. Otherwise the output should be low. You must use fewer than 9 states.
